# Electron
Sistema de gestÃ£o para micro empresas

#### To compile this project:

# --> Windows:

First, install a recent version of Node.js. We recommend that you install either the latest LTS or Current version available. Visit the Node.js download page and select the Windows Installer. Once downloaded, execute the installer and let the installation wizard guide you through the installation.

On the screen that allows you to configure the installation, make sure to select the Node.js runtime, npm package manager, and Add to PATH options.

Once installed, confirm that everything works as expected. Find the Windows PowerShell by opening the Start Menu and typing PowerShell. Open up PowerShell or another command line client of your choice and confirm that both node and npm are available:

## This command should print the version of Node.js
> node -v

## This command should print the version of npm
> npm -v

# --> Linux:

First, install a recent version of Node.js. Depending on your Linux distribution, the installation steps might differ. Assuming that you normally install software using a package manager like apt or pacman, use the official Node.js guidance on installing on Linux.

You're running Linux, so you likely already know how to operate a command line client. Open up your favorite client and confirm that both node and npm are available globally:

## This command should print the version of Node.js
> node -v

## This command should print the version of npm
> npm -v

If both commands printed a version number, you are all set! Before you get started, you might want to install a code editor suited for JavaScript development.
